Description: Flexibly simulates a dataset with time-varying covariates with user-specified exchangeable correlation structures across and within clusters. Covariates can be normal or binary and can be static within a cluster or time-varying. Time-varying normal variables can optionally have linear trajectories within each cluster. See ?make_one_dataset for the main wrapper function. See Montez-Rath et al. <arXiv:1709.10074> for methodological details.
